List of ideas:
- App that serves as a database of suppliers. It could be applied to any industry, but Iâ€™m specifically thinking about construction. The app will function as a collection of supplier cards, each containing all relevant information, such as:
    - Title
 
    - URL
 
    - Contacts
    
    - Category (industry or service type)
 
    - Specific notes (e.g., when the manager last contacted the supplier or plans to follow up)
 
    - The application will allow users to create, edit, and delete supplier cards. It will also include filtering options to quickly find information based on any criteria.

- Hotel Booking Website
    - List of hotels with details
    - Authentification for the user with user dashboard
    - Ability to book a room
    - list your own hotel to the site
- E-comerce website
    - Catalogue of items
    - Registration to your own profile
    - Admin interface to manage your store
    - Add to cart and buy items
    - Add items and delete them from the site
